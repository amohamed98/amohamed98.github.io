	<h1>Hi there, I'm Hank Quinlan!</h1>
	<h1>Hi! My name is Abdallah.</h1>
				<p>I am a Ph.D. Student and <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF-GRFP</a> Fellow at <a href="https://biology.mit.edu/graduate/">MIT Biology.</a> </p>
				<p>My research interets surround how cellular and developmental identities are established; specifically how chromatin organization and RNA processing 
					come together in order to help establish proper cellular identity.<p>
				<p>Previously I recieved my B.A. ('20) in Biology from Columbia University. At Columbia I was an undergraduate student in the <a href="https://lomvardaslab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Lomvardas Lab</a>
					where I studied the biochemical mechanisms by which long-range interactions between heterchromatically silenced gene loci are established and maintained throughout olfactory sensory neuron development.<p>
				<p>Additionally I was previsouly an <a href="https://amgenscholars.com/us-program/">Amgen Scholar</a> in the <a href="https://narlikarlab.ucsf.edu/">Narlikar Lab</a> where I studied 
					the liquid-droplet properties of heterochromatin associated proteins.<p>
