	<h1>Hi! My name is Abdallah.</h1>
				<p>I am a Ph.D. Student and <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF-GRFP</a> Fellow in the <a href="https://www.voslab.org/">Vos Lab</a> at <a href="https://biology.mit.edu/graduate/">MIT Biology</a>. </p>
				<p>My research interests focus on how cellular and developmental identities are established. Currently I am using biochemical and structural approaches to study mammalian transcriptional regulation in</a> 
					order to answer broader questions about how genes are turned on/off in order to maintain cellular identities. <p>
				<p>Before MIT, I received my B.A. ('20) in Biology from Columbia University. At Columbia I was a member of the <a href="https://lomvardaslab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Lomvardas Lab</a>
					where I studied the role genome organization plays in establishing neuronal cell identity in olfactory sensory neurons. </a>
					Additionally I was an <a href="https://amgenscholars.com/us-program/">Amgen Scholar</a> in the </a>
					<a href="https://narlikarlab.ucsf.edu/">Narlikar Lab</a> at UCSF where I studied the liquid-droplet properties of heterochromatin associated proteins.<p>
