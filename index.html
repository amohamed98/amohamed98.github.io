	<h1>Hi! My name is Abdallah.</h1>
				<p>I am a Ph.D. Student and <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF-GRFP</a> Fellow at <a href="https://biology.mit.edu/graduate/">MIT Biology</a>. </p>
				<p>My research interets focus on how cellular and developmental identities are established; specifically the role chromatin organization and RNA processing play in establishing cell identity.<p>
				<p>Before MIT, I recieved my B.A. ('20) in Biology from Columbia University. At Columbia I was a member of the <a href="https://lomvardaslab.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Lomvardas Lab</a>
					where I studied chromatin organization in olfactory sensory neurons. Additionally I was an <a href="https://amgenscholars.com/us-program/">Amgen Scholar</a> in the <a href="https://narlikarlab.ucsf.edu/">Narlikar Lab</a> at 
					UCSF where I studied the liquid-droplet properties of heterochromatin associated proteins.<p>
				<p>Please feel free to contact me with any questions/comments <a href=mailto:aam1@mit.edu>here</a>.
